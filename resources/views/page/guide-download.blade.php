    <h4>Find Documents by Country or Resource</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>To see any contract, click on the contract title to go to the View Document page.</li>
        <li>You can scroll through the full PDF document page by page, or click the “TEXT” button to
            switch
            to a text- only view.</li>
        <li>To search for specific words in the text, use the “Search in this document” box on the
            left. Note that text versions are created automatically and may contain errors.</li>
        <li>OpenLandContracts.org features Annotations (i.e. plain-language summaries) on the left
            of the
            page that explain key provisions throughout the document. See more about Annotations below.</li>
        <li>To download or share the document, use the buttons above the right column.</li>
        <li>To view key document details such as source website, Associated Documents and
            metadata, switch to the Summary Page using the green button on the right.</li>
    </ul>
