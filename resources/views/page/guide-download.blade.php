                    <li>OpenLandContracts features hundreds of contract <strong>Annotations</strong>: plain-language summaries that help to explain key provisions and to locate certain topics within a contract.</li>
                    <li>Annotations are listed <strong>alongside a contract</strong> on the left as you view the document, and marked with yellow boxes on relevant pages as you scroll through the contract PDF. Click on an Annotation to skip to the relevant page in the PDF viewer.</li>
                    <li>Annotations are organized by the Topic of the related contract provision. Topics include: <strong>Environment, Fiscal, Legal Rules, Social, Operations and General</strong>. You can view a contract's Annotations by Topic or in order by page. </li> 
                    <li>Every Annotation has its own <strong>unique web address (URL)</strong>, to make it easier to bookmark, cite, and share specific contract provisions. </li>
                    <li>Please note that Annotations offer short summaries that explain contract terms. <strong>They do not interpret or analyze the terms</strong> or the overall contract. For more about contract analysis and our methodology, see the FAQ page.</li>

Select <strong>Print</strong> to create a document with the full text of all the Annotations in your Clips. Select <strong>Download</strong> to save a file including the document with the full Annotation texts, a spreadsheet with text, metadata and URLs for each Annotation, and a PDF that compiles the contract pages that correspond to each Annotation you clipped.</li>
                    <li>To <strong>quickly compare a small number of Annotations</strong> on your screen, you can also use the red [icon] View buttons in the last column of the All Clips page.
